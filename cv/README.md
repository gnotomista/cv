To use the iCV class (with texlive):
------------------------------------

* Linux
	* copy the "iCV" folder to "/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex"
	* run "sudo -H mktexlsr"
* Windows
	* copy the "iCV" folder to "C:\Users\<username>\texmf\tex\latex\local"

Try to compile the iCV_example.tex that can be found in the "iCV_example" folder.

If it doesn't work, make sure the folder iCV in "/usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex" has the right permissions.
